## About me
Currently, I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Bologna (Italy) in molecular evolution.

## PhD Projects Description
My PhD project focuses on investigating the functionality of **smithRNAs**, a class of mitochondrially-encoded class of sncRNAs that influence nuclear transcription through RNAi in the Manila clam *Ruditapes philippinarum* (PI: M. Passamonti; F. Plazzi).

Overall, my research interests encompass the broad theme of **mito-nuclear coevolution** in metazoans. 
For instance, I am conducting projects about mitonuclear coevolution in proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the Squamata order.
Furthermore, I collaborate with other research groups:

+ **First large-scale phylogenomics on the Gastrotricha phylum** - University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: A. Todaro).
+ **MicroRNA annotation** in:
  + **Tardigrada** - The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø, PI: B. Fromm) and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: M. Cesari).
  + **Gastrotricha** - The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø, PI: B. Fromm) and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: A. Todaro)

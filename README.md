## About me
Currently, I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Bologna (Italy).

## PhD Projects Description
My PhD project focuses on investigating the functionality of smithRNAs, a class of miRNA- like small RNAs encoded in mitochondria that influence nuclear transcription through RNA interference. Additionally, I am working on quantifying tissue-specific smithRNA expression levels in the Manila clam (*Ruditapes philippinarum*). These objectives are part of the nationally relevant PRIN2020 project, MitoMicro - Mitochondrial MicroRNAs, a new perspective on mitochondrial function and their role in eukaryotic evolution (PI: M. Passamonti; F. Plazzi).

Overall, my research interests encompass the broad theme of mito-nuclear coevolution in metazoans. 
For instance, I am conducting projects about mitonuclear coevolution in proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in the Squamata order.
Furthermore, I collaborate with other research groups:

+ first large-scale phylogenomics on the Gastrotricha phylum - University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: A. Todaro).
+ microRNA annotation in:
  + Tardigrada - The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø, Norway, PI: B. Fromm) and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: M. Cesari).
  + Gastrotricha The Arctic University of Norway (Tromsø, Norway, PI: B. Fromm) and University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy, PI: A. Todaro)
